#### ROCprofiler (For ROCm 5.6.0)

In ROCm 5.6 the `rocprofilerv1` and `rocprofilerv2` include and library files of
ROCm 5.5 are split into separate files. The `rocmtools` files that were
deprecated in ROCm 5.5 have been removed.

  | ROCm 5.6        | rocprofilerv1                       | rocprofilerv2                          |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  | **Tool script** | `bin/rocprof`                       | `bin/rocprofv2`                        |
  | **API include** | `include/rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h` | `include/rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h` |
  | **API library** | `lib/librocprofiler.so.1`           | `lib/librocprofiler.so.2`              |

The ROCm Profiler Tool that uses `rocprofilerV1` can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprof …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV1` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.1`.

The ROCm Profiler that uses `rocprofilerV2` API can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprofv2 …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV2` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64-v2
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.2`.

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->
### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.5 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### Enhanced Stack Size Limit

In this release, the stack size limit is increased from 16k to 131056 bytes (or 128K - 16).
Applications requiring to update the stack size can use hipDeviceSetLimit API.

##### `hipcc` Changes

The following hipcc changes are implemented in this release:

- `hipcc` will not implicitly link to `libpthread` and `librt`, as they are no longer a link time dependence for HIP programs.  Applications that depend on these libraries must explicitly link to them.

##### New HIP APIs in This Release

> **Note**
>
> This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs and may contain unresolved issues.

###### Memory Management HIP APIs

The new memory management HIP API is as follows:

- Sets information on the specified pointer [BETA].

  ```h
  hipError_t hipPointerSetAttribute(const void* value, hipPointer_attribute attribute, hipDeviceptr_t ptr);
  ```

###### Module Management HIP APIs

The new module management HIP APIs are as follows:

- Launches kernel $f$ with launch parameters and shared memory on stream with arguments passed to `kernelParams`, where thread blocks can cooperate and synchronize as they execute.

  ```h
  hipError_t hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel(hipFunction_t f, unsigned int gridDimX, unsigned int gridDimY, unsigned int gridDimZ, unsigned int blockDimX, unsigned int blockDimY, unsigned int blockDimZ, unsigned int sharedMemBytes, hipStream_t stream, void** kernelParams);
  ```

- Launches kernels on multiple devices where thread blocks can cooperate and synchronize as they execute.

  ```h
  hipError_t hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice(hipFunctionLaunchParams* launchParamsList, unsigned int numDevices, unsigned int flags);
  ```

###### HIP Graph Management APIs

The new HIP Graph Management APIs are as follows:

- Creates a memory allocation node and adds it to a graph [BETA]

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphAddMemAllocNode(hipGraphNode_t* pGraphNode, hipGraph_t graph, const hipGraphNode_t* pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, hipMemAllocNodeParams* pNodeParams);
  ```

- Return parameters for memory allocation node [BETA]

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphMemAllocNodeGetParams(hipGraphNode_t node, hipMemAllocNodeParams* pNodeParams);
  ```

- Creates a memory free node and adds it to a graph [BETA]

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphAddMemFreeNode(hipGraphNode_t* pGraphNode, hipGraph_t graph, const hipGraphNode_t* pDependencies, size_t numDependencies, void* dev_ptr);
  ```

- Returns parameters for memory free node [BETA].

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphMemFreeNodeGetParams(hipGraphNode_t node, void* dev_ptr);
  ```

- Write a DOT file describing graph structure [BETA].

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphDebugDotPrint(hipGraph_t graph, const char* path, unsigned int flags);
  ```

- Copies attributes from source node to destination node [BETA].

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphKernelNodeCopyAttributes(hipGraphNode_t hSrc, hipGraphNode_t hDst);
  ```

- Enables or disables the specified node in the given graphExec [BETA]

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphNodeSetEnabled(hipGraphExec_t hGraphExec, hipGraphNode_t hNode, unsigned int isEnabled);
  ```

- Query whether a node in the given graphExec is enabled [BETA]

  ```h
  hipError_t hipGraphNodeGetEnabled(hipGraphExec_t hGraphExec, hipGraphNode_t hNode, unsigned int* isEnabled);
  ```

##### OpenMP Enhancements
This release consists of the following OpenMP enhancements:

- Additional support for OMPT functions `get_device_time` and `get_record_type`.
- Add support for min/max fast fp atomics on AMD GPUs.
- Fix the use of the abs function in C device regions.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

> **Note**
>
> There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from `hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.

##### Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation filesystem hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new filesystem hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older filesystem hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new filesystem hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New Filesystem Hierarchy

The following is the new filesystem hierarchy:4

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major release.

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward Compatibility with Older Filesystems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the example below:

```h
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

- `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
- `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
- `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
- Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake Config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder.
For backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

#### ROCm Support For Code Object V3 Deprecated

Support for Code Object v3 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### Comgr V3.0 Changes

The following APIs and macros have been marked as deprecated. These are expected to be removed in a future ROCm release and coincides with the release of Comgr v3.0.

##### API Changes

- `amd_comgr_action_info_set_options()`
- `amd_comgr_action_info_get_options()`

##### Actions and Data Types

- `AMD_COMGR_ACTION_ADD_DEVICE_LIBRARIES`

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Perl Scripts Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

> **Note**
>
> There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from `hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.

##### Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation filesystem hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new filesystem hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older filesystem hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new filesystem hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New Filesystem Hierarchy

The following is the new filesystem hierarchy:4

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake

        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major release.

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward Compatibility with Older Filesystems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the example below:

```h
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

- `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
- `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
- `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
- Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake Config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

### Fixed Defects

#### Compiler Improvements

In ROCm v5.4.3, improvements to the compiler address errors with the following signatures:

- "error: unhandled SGPR spill to memory"
- "cannot scavenge register without an emergency spill slot!"
- "error: ran out of registers during register allocation"

### Known Issues

#### Compiler Option Error at Runtime

Some users may encounter a “Cannot find Symbol” error at runtime when using -save-temps. While most -save-temps use cases work correctly, this error may appear occasionally.

This issue is under investigation, and the known workaround is not to use -save-temps when the error appears.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Perl Scripts Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

> **Note**
>
> There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from `hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.

#### `hipcc` Options Deprecation

The following hipcc options are being deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

- The `--amdgpu-target` option is being deprecated, and user must use the `–offload-arch` option to specify the GPU architecture.
- The `--amdhsa-code-object-version` option is being deprecated.  Users can use the Clang/LLVM option `-mllvm -mcode-object-version` to debug issues related to code object versions.
- The `--hipcc-func-supp`/`--hipcc-no-func-supp` options are being deprecated, as the function calls are already supported in production on AMD GPUs.

### Known Issues

Under certain circumstances typified by high register pressure, users may encounter a compiler abort with one of the following error messages:

- > `error: unhandled SGPR spill to memory`

- > `cannot scavenge register without an emergency spill slot!`

- > `error: ran out of registers during register allocation`

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.4.1
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.4.1 release consists of the following new HIP API:

##### New HIP API - hipLaunchHostFunc

The following new HIP API is introduced in the ROCm v5.4.1 release.

> **Note**
>
> This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs.

```h
hipError_t hipLaunchHostFunc(hipStream_t stream, hipHostFn_t fn, void* userData);
```

This swaps the stream capture mode of a thread.

```text
@param [in] mode - Pointer to mode value to swap with the current mode
```

This parameter returns `#hipSuccess`, `#hipErrorInvalidValue`.

For more information, refer to the HIP API documentation at /bundle/HIP_API_Guide/page/modules.html.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Perl Scripts Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.4 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### Support for Wall Clock64

A new timer function wall_clock64() is supported, which returns wall clock count at a constant frequency on the device.

```h
long long int wall_clock64();
```

It returns wall clock count at a constant frequency on the device, which can be queried via HIP API with the hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate attribute of the device in the HIP application code.

Example:

```h
int wallClkRate = 0; //in kilohertz
+HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&wallClkRate, hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate, deviceId));
```

Where hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate is a device attribute.

> **Note**
>
> The wall clock frequency is a per-device attribute.

##### New Registry Added for GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES

The GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES registry defines the maximum number of independent hardware queues allocated per process per device.

The environment variable controls how many independent hardware queues HIP runtime can create per process, per device. If the application allocates more HIP streams than this number, then the HIP runtime reuses the same hardware queues for the new streams in a round-robin manner.

> **Note**
>
> This maximum number does not apply to hardware queues created for CU-masked HIP streams or cooperative queues for HIP Cooperative Groups (there is only one queue per device).

For more details, refer to the HIP Programming Guide.

#### New HIP APIs in This Release

The following new HIP APIs are available in the ROCm v5.4 release.

> **Note**
>
> This is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs.

##### Error Handling

```h
hipError_t hipDrvGetErrorName(hipError_t hipError, const char** errorString);
```

This returns HIP errors in the text string format.

```h
hipError_t hipDrvGetErrorString(hipError_t hipError, const char** errorString);
```

This returns text string messages with more details about the error.

For more information, refer to the HIP API Guide.

##### HIP Tests Source Separation

With ROCm v5.4, a separate GitHub project is created at

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests>

This contains HIP catch2 tests and samples, and new tests will continue to develop.

In future ROCm releases, catch2 tests and samples will be removed from the HIP project.

### OpenMP Enhancements

This release consists of the following OpenMP enhancements:

- Enable new device RTL in libomptarget as default.
- New flag `-fopenmp-target-fast` to imply `-fopenmp-target-ignore-env-vars -fopenmp-assume-no-thread-state -fopenmp-assume-no-nested-parallelism`.
- Support for the collapse clause and non-unit stride in cases where the No-Loop specialized kernel is generated.
- Initial implementation of optimized cross-team sum reduction for float and double type scalars.
- Pool-based optimization in the OpenMP runtime to reduce locking during data transfer.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Perl Scripts Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

> **Note**
>
> There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from `hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.

The following defects are fixed in this release.

These defects were identified and documented as known issues in previous ROCm releases and are fixed in this release.

#### Memory Allocated Using hipHostMalloc() with Flags Did Not Exhibit Fine-Grain Behavior

##### Issue

The test was incorrectly using the `hipDeviceAttributePageableMemoryAccess` device attribute to determine coherent support.

##### Fix

`hipHostMalloc()` allocates memory with fine-grained access by default when the environment variable `HIP_HOST_COHERENT=1` is used.

For more information, refer to {doc}`hip:.doxygen/docBin/html/index`.


#### SoftHang with `hipStreamWithCUMask` test on AMD Instinct™

##### Issue

On GFX10 GPUs, kernel execution hangs when it is launched on streams created using `hipStreamWithCUMask`.

##### Fix

On GFX10 GPUs, each workgroup processor encompasses two compute units, and the compute units must be enabled as a pair. The `hipStreamWithCUMask` API unit test cases are updated to set compute unit mask (cuMask) in pairs for GFX10 GPUs.

#### ROCm Tools GPU IDs

The HIP language device IDs are not the same as the GPU IDs reported by the tools. GPU IDs are globally unique and guaranteed to be consistent across APIs and processes.

GPU IDs reported by ROCTracer and ROCProfiler or ROCm Tools are HSA Driver Node ID of that GPU, as it is a unique ID for that device in that particular node.

function or by parameters.
- New overload for `BlockAdjacentDifference::SubtractLeftPartialTile` that takes a predecessor item.

##### Changed

- Improved build parallelism of the test suite by splitting up large compilation units for `DeviceRadixSort`, 
`DeviceSegmentedRadixSort` and `DeviceSegmentedSort`.
- CUB backend references CUB and thrust version 1.17.1.

#### hipFFT 1.0.10

hipFFT 1.0.10 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Added hipfftExtPlanScaleFactor API to efficiently multiply each output element of a FFT by a given scaling factor.  Result scaling must be supported in the backend FFT library.

##### Changed

- When hipFFT is built against the rocFFT backend, rocFFT 1.0.19 or higher is now required.

#### hipSOLVER 1.6.0

    - hipsolverDnSgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnDgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnCgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnZgesvdaStridedBatched

#### hipSPARSE 2.3.3

hipSPARSE 2.3.3 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Added hipsparseCsr2cscEx2_bufferSize and hipsparseCsr2cscEx2 routines

##### Changed

- HIPSPARSE_ORDER_COLUMN has been renamed to HIPSPARSE_ORDER_COL to match cusparse

#### rccl 2.13.4

RCCL 2.13.4 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Changed

- Compatibility with NCCL 2.13.4
- Improvements to RCCL when running with hipGraphs
- RCCL_ENABLE_HIPGRAPH environment variable is no longer necessary to enable hipGraph support
- Minor latency improvements

##### Fixed

- Resolved potential memory access error due to asynchronous memset

#### rocALUTION 2.1.3

rocALUTION 2.1.3 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- Added build support for Navi31 and Navi33
- Added support for non-squared global matrices

##### Improved

- Fixed a memory leak in MatrixMult on HIP backend
- Global structures can now be used with a single process

##### Changed

- Switched GTest death test style to &#39;threadsafe&#39;
- GlobalVector::GetGhostSize() is deprecated and will be removed
- ParallelManager::GetGlobalSize(), ParallelManager::GetLocalSize(), ParallelManager::SetGlobalSize() and ParallelManager::SetLocalSize() are deprecated and will be removed
- Vector::GetGhostSize() is deprecated and will be removed
- Multigrid::SetOperatorFormat(unsigned int) is deprecated and will be removed, use Multigrid::SetOperatorFormat(unsigned int, int) instead
- RugeStuebenAMG::SetCouplingStrength(ValueType) is deprecated and will be removed, use SetStrengthThreshold(float) instead

#### rocBLAS 2.46.0

rocBLAS 2.46.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

##### Optimized

- Improved trsm performance for small sizes by using a substitution method technique
- Improved syr2k and her2k performance significantly by using a block-recursive algorithm

##### Changed

- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype
- Disallow B == C &amp;&amp; ldb != ldc in rocblas_xtrmm_outofplace

##### Added

- Added rocfft_plan_description_set_scale_factor API to efficiently multiply each output element of a FFT by a given scaling factor.
- Created a rocfft_kernel_cache.db file next to the installed library. SBCC kernels are moved to this file when built with the library, and are runtime-compiled for new GPU architectures.
- Added gfx1100 and gfx1102 to default AMDGPU_TARGETS.

##### Changed

- Moved runtime compilation cache to in-memory by default.  A default on-disk cache can encounter contention problems 
on multi-node clusters with a shared filesystem.  rocFFT can still be told to use an on-disk cache by setting the 
ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

#### rocPRIM 2.12.0

rocPRIM 2.12.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Changed

- `device_partition`, `device_unique`, and `device_reduce_by_key` now support problem 
  sizes larger than 2^32 items.

##### Removed

- `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size. This overload was documented but the
  implementation is missing. To avoid further confusion the documentation is removed until a decision is made on
  implementing the function.

##### Fixed

- Fixed the compilation failure in `device_merge` if the two key iterators don&#39;t match.

#### rocRAND 2.10.16

rocRAND 2.10.16 for ROCm 5.4.0

##### Added

- MRG31K3P pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer and Touzin, 2000, &#34;Fast combined multiple recursive generators with multipliers of the form a = ±2q ±2r&#34;.
- LFSR113 pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer, 1999, &#34;Tables of maximally equidistributed combined LFSR generators&#34;.
- SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32 and SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64 quasirandom number generators. The Scrambled Sobol sequences are generated by scrambling the output of a Sobol sequence.

##### Changed

- The `mrg_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution` structures, which provided numbers based on MRG32K3A, are now replaced by `mrg_engine_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution`, where `&lt;distribution&gt;` is `log_normal`, `normal`, `poisson`, or `uniform`. These structures provide numbers for MRG31K3P (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg31k3p`) and MRG32K3A (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg32k3a`).

##### Fixed

- Sobol64 now returns 64 bits random numbers, instead of 32 bits random numbers. As a result, the performance of this generator has regressed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented compiling code in C++ mode (with a host compiler) when it included the rocRAND headers on Windows.

#### rocSOLVER 3.20.0

rocSOLVER 3.20.0 for ROCm 5.4.0

<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Fixed Defects

#### Issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM Libraries

There was a known issue with rocTHRUST and rocPRIM libraries supporting iterator and types in ROCm v5.3.x releases.

- `thrust::merge` no longer correctly supports different iterator types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.
- `rocprim::device_merge` no longer correctly supports using different types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.

This issue is resolved with the following fixes to compilation failures:

- rocPRIM: in device_merge if the two key iterators do not match.
- rocTHRUST: in thrust::merge if the two key iterators do not match.

#### SGEMM (F32 GEMM) Routines in rocBLAS

Functional correctness failures in SGEMM (F32 GEMM) routines in rocBLAS for certain problem sizes and ranges are fixed in this release.

### Known Issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 SRIOV Virtualization Issue

There is a known issue in this ROCm v5.3 release with all AMD Instinct™ MI200 devices running within a virtual function (VF) under SRIOV virtualization. This issue will likely impact the functionality of SRIOV-based workloads but does not impact Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) or bare metal.

Until a fix is provided, users should rely on ROCm v5.2.3 to support their SRIOV workloads.

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 Firmware Updates

Customers cannot update the Integrated Firmware Image (IFWI) for AMD Instinct™ MI200 accelerators.

An updated firmware maintenance bundle consisting of an installation tool and images specific to AMD Instinct™ MI200 accelerators is under planning and will be available soon.

#### Known Issue with rocThrust and rocPRIM Libraries

There is a known known issue with rocThrust and rocPRIM libraries supporting iterator and types in ROCm v5.3.x releases.

- thrust::merge no longer correctly supports different iterator types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.

- rocprim::device_merge no longer correctly supports using different types for `keys_input1` and `keys_input2`.

This issue is currently under investigation and will be resolved in a future release.

## ROCm 5.3.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and Warnings

#### HIP Perl Scripts Deprecation

The `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are deprecated. In a future release, compiled binaries will be available as `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` as replacements for the Perl scripts.

> **Note**
>
> There will be a transition period where the Perl scripts and compiled binaries are available  before the scripts are removed. There will be no functional difference between the Perl scripts and their compiled binary counterpart. No user action is required. Once these are available, users can optionally switch to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin`. The `hipcc`/`hipconfig` soft link will be assimilated to point from `hipcc`/`hipconfig` to the respective compiled binaries as the default option.

#### Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation filesystem hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new filesystem hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older filesystem hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new filesystem hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New Filesystem Hierarchy

The following is the new filesystem hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major release.

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward Compatibility with Older Filesystems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the example below:

```h
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

- `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
- `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
- `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
- Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake Config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

### Fixed Defects

The following defects are fixed in this release.

These defects were identified and documented as known issues in previous ROCm releases and are fixed in the ROCm v5.3 release.

#### Kernel produces incorrect results with ROCm 5.2

User code did not initialize certain data constructs, leading to a correctness issue. A strict reading of the C++ standard suggests that failing to initialize these data constructs is undefined behavior. However, a special case was added for a specific compiler builtin to handle the uninitialized data in a defined manner.

The compiler fix consists of the following patches:

- A new `noundef` attribute is added. This attribute denotes when a function call argument or return val may never contain uninitialized bits.

- The application of this attribute was refined such that it was not added to a specific compiler builtin where the compiler knows that inactive lanes do not impact program execution.

### Known Issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### Issue with OpenMP-Extras Package Upgrade

The `openmp-extras` package has been split into runtime (`openmp-extras-runtime`) and dev (`openmp-extras-devel`) packages. This change has broken the upgrade support for the `openmp-extras` package in RHEL/SLES.
An available workaround in RHEL is to use the following command for upgrades:

```sh
sudo yum upgrade rocm-language-runtime --allowerasing

```

An available workaround in SLES is to use the following command for upgrades:

```sh
zypper update --force-resolution <meta-package>
```

#### AMD Instinct™ MI200 SRIOV Virtualization Issue

There is a known issue in this ROCm v5.3 release with all AMD Instinct™ MI200 devices running within a virtual function (VF) under SRIOV virtualization. This issue will likely impact the functionality of SRIOV-based workloads, but does not impact Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) or Bare Metal.

Until a fix is provided, users should rely on ROCm v5.2.3 to support their SRIOV workloads.

#### System Crash when IMMOU is Enabled

If IOMMU is enabled in SBIOS and ROCm is installed, the system may report the following failure or errors when running workloads such as bandwidth test, clinfo, and HelloWord.cl and cause a system crash.

- IO PAGE FAULT
- IRQ remapping does not support X2APIC mode
- NMI error

Workaround: To avoid the system crash, add `amd_iommu=on iommu=pt` as the kernel bootparam, as indicated in the warning message.

hipSPARSE 2.3.1 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- Add SpMM and SpMM batched for CSC format

#### rocALUTION 2.1.0

rocALUTION 2.1.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- Benchmarking tool
- Ext+I Interpolation with sparsify strategies added for RS-AMG

##### Improved

- ParallelManager

#### rocBLAS 2.45.0

rocBLAS 2.45.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- install.sh option --upgrade_tensile_venv_pip to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP.
- install.sh option --relocatable or -r adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build.
- install.sh option --lazy-library-loading to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization.
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9.
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value.

##### Optimizations

- trmm_outofplace performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- herkx performance improvements for all sizes and data types using block-recursive algorithm.
- syrk/herk performance improvements by utilising optimised syrkx/herkx code.
- symm/hemm performance improvements for all sizes and datatypes using block-recursive algorithm.

##### Changed

- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (-&gt;HHS_BH), BBH (-&gt;BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (-&gt;4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset.
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions.
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.
- Modified the matrix and vector memory allocation in our test infrastructure for all Level 1, 2, 3 and BLAS_EX functions.
- Added specific initialization for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrix types in our test infrastructure.
- Added NaN tests to the test infrastructure for the rest of Level 3, BLAS_EX functions.

##### Fixed

- Improved logic to #include &lt;filesystem&gt; vs &lt;experimental/filesystem&gt;.
- install.sh -s option to build rocblas as a static library.
- dot function now sets the device results asynchronously for N &lt;= 0

##### Deprecated

- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use rocblas_is_complex instead.
- The enum truncate_t and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by rocblas_truncate_t and rocblas_truncate, respectively. The new enum rocblas_truncate_t and the value rocblas_truncate could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition.

##### Removed

- install.sh options  --hip-clang , --no-hip-clang, --merge-files, --no-merge-files are removed.

#### rocFFT 1.0.18

rocFFT 1.0.18 for ROCm 5.3.0

- Improved performance of the Bluestein algorithm.
- Optimized sbcc-168 and 100 by using half-lds.

##### Fixed

- Fixed occasional failures to parallelize runtime compilation of kernels.
  Failures would be retried serially and ultimately succeed, but this would take extra time.
- Fixed failures of some R2C 3D transforms that use the unsupported TILE_UNALGNED SBRC kernels.
  An example is 98^3 R2C out-of-place.
- Fixed bugs in SBRC_ERC type.

#### rocm-cmake 0.8.0

rocm-cmake 0.8.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Fixed

- Fixed error in prerm scripts created by `rocm_create_package` that could break uninstall for packages using the `PTH` option.

##### Changed

- `ROCM_USE_DEV_COMPONENT` set to on by default for all platforms. This means that Windows will now generate runtime and devel packages by default
- ROCMInstallTargets now defaults `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` to `lib` if not otherwise specified.
- Changed default Debian compression type to xz and enabled multi-threaded package compression.
- `rocm_create_package` will no longer warn upon failure to determine version of program rpmbuild.

#### rocPRIM 2.11.0

rocPRIM 2.11.0 for ROCm 5.3.0

##### Added

- New functions `subtract_left` and `subtract_right` in `block_adjacent_difference` to apply functions
  on pairs of adjacent items distributed between threads in a block.

## ROCm 5.2.3
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Changes in This Release

#### Ubuntu 18.04 End of Life Announcement

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 ends in this release. Future releases of ROCm will not provide prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 18.04.
HIP and Other Runtimes

#### HIP Runtime

##### Fixes

- A bug was discovered in the HIP graph capture implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. If the same kernel is called twice (with different argument values) in a graph capture, the implementation only kept the argument values for the second kernel call.

- A bug was introduced in the hiprtc implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0 release. This bug caused the `hiprtcGetLoweredName` call to fail for named expressions with whitespace in it.

Example:

The named expression `my_sqrt<complex<double>>` passed but `my_sqrt<complex<double >>` failed.
ROCm Libraries

#### RCCL

##### Added

Compatibility with NCCL 2.12.10

- Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack

- Added custom signal handler - opt-in with RCCL_ENABLE_SIGNALHANDLER=1

  - Additional details provided if Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is pre-installed.

- Added experimental support for using multiple ranks per device

  - Requires using a new interface to create communicator (ncclCommInitRankMulti), refer to the interface documentation for details.

  - To avoid potential deadlocks, user might have to set an environment variables increasing    the number of hardware queues. For example,

```sh
export GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=16
```

- Added support for reusing ports in NET/IB channels

  - Opt-in with NCCL_IB_SOCK_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE=1 and NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE=1

  - When "Call to bind failed: Address already in use" error happens in large-scale AlltoAll(for example, >=64 MI200 nodes), users are suggested to opt-in either one or both of the options to resolve the massive port usage issue

  - Avoid using NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE when NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER is tuned >1

##### Removed

- Removed experimental clique-based kernels

## ROCm 5.2.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-duplicate-header -->
### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.2 release consists of the following HIP enhancements:

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP tests from source on the AMD and NVIDIA platforms.

For more details, refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.2.

##### Support for device-side malloc on HIP-Clang

HIP-Clang now supports device-side malloc. This implementation does not require the use of `hipDeviceSetLimit(hipLimitMallocHeapSize,value)` nor respect any setting. The heap is fully dynamic and can grow until the available free memory on the device is consumed.

The test codes at the following link show how to implement applications using malloc and free functions in device kernels:

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/develop/tests/src/deviceLib/hipDeviceMalloc.cpp>

##### New HIP APIs in This Release

The following new HIP APIs are available in the ROCm v5.2 release. Note that this is a pre-official version (beta) release of the new APIs:

###### Device management HIP APIs

The new device management HIP APIs are as follows:

- Gets a UUID for the device. This API returns a UUID for the device.

  ```h
  hipError_t hipDeviceGetUuid(hipUUID* uuid, hipDevice_t device);
  ```

  > **Note**
  >
  > This new API corresponds to the following CUDA API:
  >
  > ```h
  > CUresult cuDeviceGetUuid(CUuuid* uuid, CUdevice dev);
  > ```

- Gets default memory pool of the specified device

  ```h
  hipError_t hipDeviceGetDefaultMemPool(hipMemPool_t* mem_pool, int device);
  ```

- Sets the current memory pool of a device

  ```h
  hipError_t hipDeviceSetMemPool(int device, hipMemPool_t mem_pool);
  ```

- Gets the current memory pool for the specified device

  ```h

##### Planned HIP Changes in Future Releases

Changes to `hipDeviceProp_t`, `HIPMEMCPY_3D`, and `hipArray` structures (and related HIP APIs) are planned in the next major release. These changes may impact backward compatibility.

Refer to the Release Notes document in subsequent releases for more information.
ROCm Math and Communication Libraries

In this release, ROCm Math and Communication Libraries consist of the following enhancements and fixes:
New rocWMMA for Matrix Multiplication and Accumulation Operations Acceleration

This release introduces a new ROCm C++ library for accelerating mixed precision matrix multiplication and accumulation (MFMA) operations leveraging specialized GPU matrix cores. rocWMMA provides a C++ API to facilitate breaking down matrix multiply accumulate problems into fragments and using them in block-wise operations that are distributed in parallel across GPU wavefronts. The API is a header library of GPU device code, meaning matrix core acceleration may be compiled directly into your kernel device code. This can benefit from compiler optimization in the generation of kernel assembly and does not incur additional overhead costs of linking to external runtime libraries or having to launch separate kernels.

rocWMMA is released as a header library and includes test and sample projects to validate and illustrate example usages of the C++ API. GEMM matrix multiplication is used as primary validation given the heavy precedent for the library. However, the usage portfolio is growing significantly and demonstrates different ways rocWMMA may be consumed.

For more information, refer to
[Communication Libraries](../../../../docs/reference/gpu_libraries/communication.md).

#### OpenMP Enhancements in This Release

##### OMPT Target Support

The OpenMP runtime in ROCm implements a subset of the OMPT device APIs, as described in the OpenMP specification document. These are APIs that allow first-party tools to examine the profile and traces for kernels that execute on a device. A tool may register callbacks for data transfer and kernel dispatch entry points. A tool may use APIs to start and stop tracing for device-related activities such as data transfer and kernel dispatch timings and associated metadata. If device tracing is enabled, trace records for device activities are collected during program execution and returned to the tool using the APIs described in the specification.

Following is an example demonstrating how a tool would use the OMPT target APIs supported. The README in /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt outlines the steps to follow, and you can run the provided example as indicated below:

```sh
cd /opt/rocm/llvm/examples/tools/ompt/veccopy-ompt-target-tracing
make run
```

The file `veccopy-ompt-target-tracing.c` simulates how a tool would initiate device activity tracing. The file `callbacks.h` shows the callbacks that may be registered and implemented by the tool.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard for ROCm

ROCm packages have adopted the Linux foundation filesystem hierarchy standard in this release to ensure ROCm components follow open source conventions for Linux-based distributions. While moving to a new filesystem hierarchy, ROCm ensures backward compatibility with its 5.1 version or older filesystem hierarchy. See below for a detailed explanation of the new filesystem hierarchy and backward compatibility.

##### New Filesystem Hierarchy

The following is the new filesystem hierarchy:

```text
/opt/rocm-<ver>
    | --bin
      | --All externally exposed Binaries
    | --libexec
        | --<component>
            | -- Component specific private non-ISA executables (architecture independent)
    | --include
        | -- <component>
            | --<header files>
    | --lib
        | --lib<soname>.so -> lib<soname>.so.major -> lib<soname>.so.major.minor.patch
            (public libraries linked with application)
        | --<component> (component specific private library, executable data)
        | --<cmake>
            | --components
                | --<component>.config.cmake
    | --share
        | --html/<component>/*.html
        | --info/<component>/*.[pdf, md, txt]
        | --man
        | --doc
            | --<component>
                | --<licenses>
        | --<component>
            | --<misc files> (arch independent non-executable)
            | --samples

```

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will not support backward compatibility with the v5.1(old) file system hierarchy in its next major release.

For more information, refer to <https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml>.

##### Backward Compatibility with Older Filesystems

ROCm has moved header files and libraries to its new location as indicated in the above structure and included symbolic-link and wrapper header files in its old location for backward compatibility.

> **Note**
>
> ROCm will continue supporting backward compatibility until the next major release.

##### Wrapper header files

Wrapper header files are placed in the old location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/include`) with a warning message to include files from the new location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/include`) as shown in the example below:

```h
// Code snippet from hip_runtime.h
#pragma message “This file is deprecated. Use file from include path /opt/rocm-ver/include/ and prefix with hip”.
#include "hip/hip_runtime.h"
```

The wrapper header files’ backward compatibility deprecation is as follows:

- `#pragma` message announcing deprecation -- ROCm v5.2 release
- `#pragma` message changed to `#warning` -- Future release
- `#warning` changed to `#error` -- Future release
- Backward compatibility wrappers removed -- Future release

##### Library files

Library files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib` folder. For backward compatibility, the old library location (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib`) has a soft link to the library at the new location.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 May 12 10:45 cmake
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   24 May 10 23:32 libamdhip64.so -> ../../lib/libamdhip64.so
```

##### CMake Config files

All CMake configuration files are available in the `/opt/rocm-xxx/lib/cmake/<component>` folder. For backward compatibility, the old CMake locations (`/opt/rocm-xxx/<component>/lib/cmake`) consist of a soft link to the new CMake config.

Example:

```log
$ ls -l /opt/rocm/hip/lib/cmake/hip/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 42 May 10 23:32 hip-config.cmake -> ../../../../lib/cmake/hip/hip-config.cmake
```

#### Planned deprecation of hip-rocclr and hip-base packages

In the ROCm v5.2 release, hip-rocclr and hip-base packages (Debian and RPM) are planned for deprecation and will be removed in a future release. hip-runtime-amd and hip-dev(el) will replace these packages respectively. Users of hip-rocclr must install two packages, hip-runtime-amd and hip-dev, to get the same set of packages installed by hip-rocclr previously.

Currently, both package names hip-rocclr (or) hip-runtime-amd and hip-base (or) hip-dev(el) are supported.
Deprecation of Integrated HIP Directed Tests

The integrated HIP directed tests, which are currently built by default, are deprecated in this release. The default building and execution support through CMake will be removed in future release.

### Known Issues

This section consists of known issues in this release.

#### Compiler Error on gfx1030 When Compiling at -O0

##### Issue

A compiler error occurs when using -O0 flag to compile code for gfx1030 that calls atomicAddNoRet, which is defined in amd_hip_atomic.h. The compiler generates an illegal instruction for gfx1030.

##### Workaround

The workaround is not to use the -O0 flag for this case. For higher optimization levels, the compiler does not generate an invalid instruction.

#### System Freeze Observed During CUDA Memtest Checkpoint

##### Issue

Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU) requires 20 MB of VRAM approximately to checkpoint and restore. The CRIU process may freeze if the maximum amount of available VRAM is allocated to checkpoint applications.

##### Workaround

To use CRIU to checkpoint and restore your application, limit the amount of VRAM the application uses to ensure at least 20 MB is available.

#### HPC test fails with the “HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_FAULT” error

##### Issue

The compiler may incorrectly compile a program that uses the `__shfl_sync(mask, value, srcLane)` function when the "value" parameter to the function is undefined along some path to the function. For most functions, uninitialized inputs cause undefined behavior, but the definition for `__shfl_sync` should allow for undefined values.

##### Workaround

The workaround is to initialize the parameters to `__shfl_sync`.

> **Note**
>
> When the `-Wall` compilation flag is used, the compiler generates a warning indicating the variable is initialized along some path.

Example:

```cpp
double res = 0.0; // Initialize the input to __shfl_sync.
if (lane == 0) {
  res = <some expression>
}
res = __shfl_sync(mask, res, 0);
```

#### Kernel produces incorrect result

##### Issue

In recent changes to Clang, insertion of the noundef attribute to all the function arguments has been enabled by default.

In the HIP kernel, variable var in shfl_sync may not be initialized, so LLVM IR treats it as undef.

So, the function argument that is potentially undef (because it is not intialized) has always been assumed to be noundef by LLVM IR (since Clang has inserted noundef attribute). This leads to ambiguous kernel execution.

##### Workaround

- Skip adding `noundef` attribute to functions tagged with convergent  attribute. Refer to <https://reviews.llvm.org/D124158> for more information.

- Introduce shuffle attribute and add it to `__shfl` like APIs at hip headers. Clang can skip adding noundef attribute, if it finds that argument is tagged with shuffle attribute. Refer to <https://reviews.llvm.org/D125378> for more information.

- Introduce clang builtin for `__shfl` to identify it and skip adding `noundef` attribute.

- Introduce `__builtin_freeze` to use on the relevant arguments in library wrappers. The library/header need to insert freezes on the relevant inputs.

#### Issue with Applications Triggering Oversubscription

There is a known issue with applications that trigger oversubscription. A hardware hang occurs when ROCgdb is used on AMD Instinct™ MI50 and MI100 systems.

This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.1.0
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-blanks-blockquote -->
### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.1 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include installation and building HIP from source on the AMD and NVIDIA platforms.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.1 for more details.

##### Support for HIP Graph

ROCm v5.1 extends support for HIP Graph.

##### Planned Changes for HIP in Future Releases

###### Separation of hiprtc (libhiprtc) library from hip runtime (amdhip64)

On ROCm/Linux, to maintain backward compatibility, the hipruntime library (amdhip64) will continue to include hiprtc symbols in future releases. The backward compatible support may be discontinued by removing hiprtc symbols from the hipruntime library (amdhip64) in the next major release.

###### hipDeviceProp_t Structure Enhancements

Changes to the hipDeviceProp_t structure in the next major release may result in backward incompatibility.  More details on these changes will be provided in subsequent releases.

#### ROCDebugger Enhancements

##### Multi-language Source Level Debugger

The compiler now generates a source-level variable and function argument debug information.

The accuracy is guaranteed if the compiler options `-g -O0` are used and apply only to HIP.

This enhancement enables ROCDebugger users to interact with the HIP source-level variables and function arguments.

> **Note**
>
> The newly-suggested compiler -g option must be used instead of the previously-suggested `-ggdb` option. Although the effect of these two options is currently equivalent, this is not guaranteed for the future and might get changed by the upstream LLVM community.

##### Machine Interface Lanes Support

ROCDebugger Machine Interface (MI) extends support to lanes. The following enhancements are made:

- Added a new -lane-info command, listing the current thread's lanes.

- The -thread-select command now supports a lane switch to switch to a specific lane of a thread:

  ```sh
  -thread-select -l LANE THREAD
  ```

- The =thread-selected notification gained a lane-id attribute. This enables the frontend to know which lane of the thread was selected.

- The *stopped asynchronous record gained lane-id and hit-lanes attributes.  The former indicates which lane is selected, and the latter indicates which lanes explain the stop.

- MI commands now accept a global --lane option, similar to the global --thread and --frame options.

- MI varobjs are now lane-aware.

For more information, refer to the ROC Debugger User Guide at
{doc}`ROCgdb <rocgdb:index>`.

##### Enhanced - clone-inferior Command

The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD, ARGS, and AMDGPU PRECISE-MEMORY settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one.  All modifications to the environment variables done using the 'set environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the new inferior.

#### MIOpen Support for RDNA GPUs

This release includes support for AMD Radeon™ Pro W6800, in addition to other bug fixes and performance improvements as listed below:

- MIOpen now supports RDNA GPUs!! (via MIOpen PRs 973, 780, 764, 740, 739, 677, 660, 653, 493, 498)

- Fixed a correctness issue with ImplicitGemm algorithm

- Updated the performance data for new kernel versions

- Improved MIOpen build time by splitting large kernel header files

- Fixed an issue in reduction kernels for padded tensors

- Various other bug fixes and performance improvements

For more information, see {doc}`Documentation <miopen:index>`.

#### Checkpoint Restore Support With CRIU

The new Checkpoint Restore in Userspace (CRIU) functionality is implemented to support AMD GPU and ROCm applications.

CRIU is a userspace tool to Checkpoint and Restore an application.

CRIU lacked the support for checkpoint restore applications that used device files such as a GPU. With this ROCm release, CRIU is enhanced with a new plugin to support AMD GPUs, which includes:

- Single and Multi GPU systems (Gfx9)

- Checkpoint / Restore on a different system

- Checkpoint / Restore inside a docker container

- PyTorch

- Tensorflow

- Using CRIU Image Streamer

For more information, refer to <https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/tree/criu-dev/plugins/amdgpu>

> **Note**
>
> The CRIU plugin (amdgpu_plugin) is merged upstream with the CRIU repository. The KFD kernel patches are also available upstream with the amd-staging-drm-next branch (public) and the ROCm 5.1 release branch.

> **Note**
>
> This is a Beta release of the Checkpoint and Restore functionality, and some features are not available in this release.

For more information, refer to the following websites:

- <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/criu/blob/amdgpu_plugin-03252022/Documentation/amdgpu_plugin.txt>

- <https://criu.org/Main_Page>

### Fixed Defects

The following defects are fixed in this release.

#### Driver Fails To Load after Installation

The issue with the driver failing to load after ROCm installation is now fixed.

The driver installs successfully, and the server reboots with working rocminfo and clinfo.

#### ROCDebugger Fixed Defects

##### Breakpoints in GPU kernel code Before Kernel Is Loaded

Previously, setting a breakpoint in device code by line number before the device code was loaded into the program resulted in ROCgdb incorrectly moving the breakpoint to the first following line that contains host code.

Now, the breakpoint is left pending.  When the GPU kernel gets loaded, the breakpoint resolves to a location in the kernel.

##### Registers Invalidated After Write

Previously, the stale just-written value was presented as a current value.

ROCgdb now invalidates the cached values of registers whose content might differ after being written.  For example, registers with read-only bits.

ROCgdb also invalidates all volatile registers when a volatile register is written.  For example, writing VCC invalidates the content of STATUS as STATUS.VCCZ may change.

##### Scheduler-locking and GPU Wavefronts

When scheduler-locking is in effect, new wavefronts created by a resumed thread, CPU, or GPU wavefront, are held in the halt state. For example, the "set scheduler-locking" command.

##### ROCDebugger Fails Before Completion of Kernel Execution

It was possible (although erroneous) for a debugger to load GPU code in memory, send it to the device, start executing a kernel on the device, and dispose of the original code before the kernel had finished execution.  If a breakpoint was hit after this point, the debugger failed with an internal error while trying to access the debug information.

This issue is now fixed by ensuring that the debugger keeps a local copy of the original code and debug information.

### Known Issues

#### Random Memory Access Fault Errors Observed While Running Math Libraries Unit Tests

**Issue:** Random memory access fault issues are observed while running Math libraries unit tests. This issue is encountered in ROCm v5.0, ROCm v5.0.1, and ROCm v5.0.2.

Note, the faults only occur in the SRIOV environment.

**Workaround:** Use SDMA to update the page table. The Guest set up steps are as follows:

```sh
sudo modprobe amdgpu vm_update_mode=0
```

To verify, use

**Guest:**

```sh
cat /sys/module/amdgpu/parameters/vm_update_mode 0
```

Where expectation is 0.

#### CU Masking Causes Application to Freeze

Using CU Masking results in an application freeze or runs exceptionally slowly. This issue is noticed only in the GFX10 suite of products. Note, this issue is observed only in GFX10 suite of products.

This issue is under active investigation at this time.

#### Failed Checkpoint in Docker Containers

A defect with Ubuntu images kernel-5.13-30-generic and kernel-5.13-35-generic with Overlay FS results in incorrect reporting of the mount ID.

This issue with Ubuntu causes CRIU checkpointing to fail in Docker containers.

As a workaround, use an older version of the kernel. For example, Ubuntu 5.11.0-46-generic.

#### Issue with Restoring Workloads Using Cooperative Groups Feature

Workloads that use the cooperative groups function to ensure all waves can be resident at the same time may fail to restore correctly.
This issue is under investigation and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 Workstation GPUs

##### No Support for ROCDebugger on SRIOV

ROCDebugger is not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

#### Random Error Messages in ROCm SMI for SR-IOV

Random error messages are generated by unsupported functions or commands.

This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release.

## ROCm 5.0.2
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Fixed Defects

The following defects are fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

#### Issue with hostcall Facility in HIP Runtime

In ROCm v5.0, when using the “assert()” call in a HIP kernel, the compiler may sometimes fail to emit kernel metadata related to the hostcall facility, which results in incomplete initialization of the hostcall facility in the HIP runtime. This can cause the HIP kernel to crash when it attempts to execute the “assert()” call.

The root cause was an incorrect check in the compiler to determine whether the hostcall facility is required by the kernel. This is fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

The resolution includes a compiler change, which emits the required metadata by default, unless the compiler can prove that the hostcall facility is not required by the kernel. This ensures that the “assert()” call never fails.

Note:
This fix may lead to breakage in some OpenMP offload use cases, which use print inside a target region and result in an abort in device code. The issue will be fixed in a future release.
Compatibility Matrix Updates to ROCm Deep Learning Guide

The compatibility matrix in the AMD Deep Learning Guide is updated for ROCm v5.0.2.

## ROCm 5.0.1
<!-- markdownlint-disable first-line-h1 -->
### Deprecations and Warnings

#### Refactor of HIPCC/HIPCONFIG

In prior ROCm releases, by default, the hipcc/hipconfig Perl scripts were used to identify and set target compiler options, target platform, compiler, and runtime appropriately.

In ROCm v5.0.1, hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin have been added as the compiled binary implementations of the hipcc and hipconfig. These new binaries are currently a work-in-progress, considered, and marked as experimental. ROCm plans to fully transition to hipcc.bin and hipconfig.bin in the a future ROCm release. The existing hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are renamed to hipcc.pl and hipconfig.pl respectively. New top-level hipcc and hipconfig Perl scripts are created, which can switch between the Perl script or the compiled binary based on the environment variable HIPCC_USE_PERL_SCRIPT.

In ROCm 5.0.1, by default, this environment variable is set to use hipcc and hipconfig through the Perl scripts.

Subsequently, Perl scripts will no longer be available in ROCm in a future release.

### What's New in This Release

#### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.0 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

##### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP from source on the NVIDIA platform.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.0 for more details.

##### Managed Memory Allocation

Managed memory, including the `__managed__` keyword, is now supported in the HIP combined host/device compilation. Through unified memory allocation, managed memory allows data to be shared and accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a single pointer. The allocation is managed by the AMD GPU driver using the Linux Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) mechanism. The user can call managed memory API hipMallocManaged to allocate a large chunk of HMM memory, execute kernels on a device, and fetch data between the host and device as needed.

> **Note**
>
> In a HIP application,  it is recommended to do a capability check before calling the managed memory APIs. For example,
>
> ```cpp
> int managed_memory = 0;
> HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&managed_memory,
>   hipDeviceAttributeManagedMemory,p_gpuDevice));
> if (!managed_memory ) {
>   printf ("info: managed memory access not supported on the device %d\n Skipped\n", p_gpuDevice);
> }
> else {
>   HIPCHECK(hipSetDevice(p_gpuDevice));
>   HIPCHECK(hipMallocManaged(&Hmm, N * sizeof(T)));
> . . .
> }
> ```

> **Note**
>
> The managed memory capability check may not be necessary; however, if HMM is not supported, managed malloc will fall back to using system memory. Other managed memory API calls will, then, have

Refer to the HIP API documentation for more details on managed memory APIs.

For the application, see

<https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/rocm-4.5.x/tests/src/runtimeApi/memory/hipMallocManaged.cpp>

#### New Environment Variable

The following new environment variable is added in this release:

| Environment Variable | Value                 | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT    | 0 or 1 (default is 0) | Some processors support more CUs than can reliably be used in a cooperative dispatch. Setting the environment variable HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to 1 will cause ROCr to return the correct CU count for cooperative groups through the HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT attribute of hsa_agent_get_info(). Setting HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT to other values, or leaving it unset, will cause ROCr to return the same CU count for the attributes HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT and HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT. Future ROCm releases will make HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT=1 the default. |

### Breaking Changes

#### Runtime Breaking Change

Re-ordering of the enumerated type in hip_runtime_api.h to better match NV.  See below for the difference in enumerated types.

ROCm software will be affected if any of the defined enums listed below are used in the code.  Applications built with ROCm v5.0 enumerated types will work with a ROCm 4.5.2 driver. However, an undefined behavior error will occur with a ROCm v4.5.2 application that uses these enumerated types with a ROCm 5.0 runtime.

### Known Issues

#### Incorrect dGPU Behavior When Using AMDVBFlash Tool

The AMDVBFlash tool, used for flashing the VBIOS image to dGPU, does not communicate with the ROM Controller specifically when the driver is present. This is because the driver, as part of its runtime power management feature, puts the dGPU to a sleep state.

As a workaround, users can run amdgpu.runpm=0, which temporarily disables the runtime power management feature from the driver and dynamically changes some power control-related sysfs files.

#### Issue with START Timestamp in ROCProfiler

Users may encounter an issue with the enabled timestamp functionality for monitoring one or multiple counters. ROCProfiler outputs the following four timestamps for each kernel:

- Dispatch

- Start

- End

- Complete

##### Issue

This defect is related to the Start timestamp functionality, which incorrectly shows an earlier time than the Dispatch timestamp.

To reproduce the issue,

1. Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag.

2. Use the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor.

3. Run the program.

4. Check the output result file.

##### Current behavior

BeginNS is lower than DispatchNS, which is incorrect.

##### Expected behavior

The correct order is:

Dispatch < Start < End < Complete

Users cannot use ROCProfiler to measure the time spent on each kernel because of the incorrect timestamp with counter collection enabled.

##### Recommended Workaround

Users are recommended to collect kernel execution timestamps without monitoring counters, as follows:

1. ​Enable timing using the --timestamp on flag, and run the application.

2. Rerun the application using the -i option with the input filename that contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor, and save this to a different output file using the -o flag.

3. Check the output result file from step 1.

4. The order of timestamps correctly displays as:
  DispathNS < BeginNS < EndNS < CompleteNS

5. Users can find the values of the collected counters in the output file generated in step 2.

#### Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 Workstation GPUs

##### No Support for SMI and ROCDebugger on SRIOV

System Management Interface (SMI) and ROCDebugger are not supported in the SRIOV environment on any GPU. For more information, refer to the Systems Management Interface documentation.

### Deprecations and Warnings

#### ROCm Libraries Changes – Deprecations and Deprecation Removal

- The hipFFT.h header is now provided only by the hipFFT package.  Up to ROCm 5.0, users would get hipFFT.h in the rocFFT package too.

- The GlobalPairwiseAMG class is now entirely removed, users should use the PairwiseAMG class instead.

- The rocsparse_spmm signature in 5.0 was changed to match that of rocsparse_spmm_ex.  In 5.0, rocsparse_spmm_ex is still present, but deprecated. Signature diff for rocsparse_spmm

#### HIP API Deprecations and Warnings

##### Warning - Arithmetic Operators of HIP Complex and Vector Types

In this release, arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types are deprecated.

- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP complex types, users can use arithmetic operators of `std::complex` types.

- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP vector types, users can use the operators of the native clang vector type associated with the data member of HIP vector types.

During the deprecation, two macros `_HIP_ENABLE_COMPLEX_OPERATORS` and `_HIP_ENABLE_VECTOR_OPERATORS` are provided to allow users to conditionally enable arithmetic operators of HIP complex or vector types.

Note, the two macros are mutually exclusive and, by default, set to Off.

The arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types will be removed in a future release.

Refer to the HIP API Guide for more information.

#### Warning - Compiler-Generated Code Object Version 4 Deprecation

Support for loading compiler-generated code object version 4 will be deprecated in a future release with no release announcement and replaced with code object 5 as the default version.

The current default is code object version 4.

#### Warning - MIOpenTensile Deprecation

MIOpenTensile will be deprecated in a future release.

- The block sizes for device merge sorts initial block sort and its merge steps are now separate in its kernel config
    - the block sort step supports multiple items per thread

##### Changed

- size_limit for scan, reduce and transform can now be set in the config struct instead of a parameter
- Device_scan and device_segmented_scan: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
  - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
  - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)
- Revert old Fiji workaround, because they solved the issue at compiler side

- Increased parallelism of specialized kernels when compiling from source, reducing build times on multi-core systems.

##### Changed

- The rocsolver-test client now prints the rocSOLVER version used to run the tests,
  rather than the version used to build them
- The rocsolver-bench client now prints the rocSOLVER version used in the benchmark

##### Fixed

- Added missing stdint.h include to rocsolver.h
