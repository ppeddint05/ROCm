# Upgrading Using the Graphical Interface

The steps to uninstall the HIP SDK for Windows are described in this document.

## HIP SDK Upgrade

To upgrade an existing installation of the HIP SDK without preserving the
previous version, first uninstall it, then install the new version following the
instructions in {doc}`/deploy/windows/cli/uninstall` and
{doc}`/deploy/windows/cli/install` using the old and new installers
respectively.

To upgrade by installing both versions side-by-side, just run the installer of
the newer version.
