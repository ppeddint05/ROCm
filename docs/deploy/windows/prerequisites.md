You must perform the following steps before installing ROCm and check if the
system meets all the requirements to proceed with the installation.

## Confirm the System Is Supported

The ROCm installation is supported only on specific host architectures, Windows
Editions and update versions.

### Check the Windows Editions and Update Version on Your System

   your system from a PowerShell Command Line Interface (CLI):

   ```pwsh

   ```

2. Confirm that the obtained information matches with those listed in
   {ref}`supported_skus`.

   **Example:** Running the command above on a Windows system may result in the
   following output:

   ```output
   CsSystemType OsName                   OSDisplayVersion
   ------------ ------                   ----------------
